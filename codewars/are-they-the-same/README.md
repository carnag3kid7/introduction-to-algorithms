Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) (compSame(a, b) in Clojure) that checks whether the two arrays have the same elements, with the same multiplicities. Same means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.

If a or b are nil (or null or None), the problem doesn't make sense so return false.

If a or b are empty the result is evident by itsel

Usage: ruby code.rb <array1> <array2>
